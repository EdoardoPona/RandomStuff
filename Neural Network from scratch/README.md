An implementation of a 3 layer neural network in simple numpy with the mnist dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data . 
You can use the model's B1 and B2 variables during backpropagation to perform feedback alignment, performance will be 
slightly worse, but it is more biologically plausible.
